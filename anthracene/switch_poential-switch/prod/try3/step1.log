                      :-) GROMACS - gmx grompp, 2022.4 (-:

Executable:   /usr/local/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /usr/local
Working dir:  /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/anthracene/switch_poential-switch/prod/try3
Command line:
  gmx grompp -f expanded.mdp -c ../../NVT/nvt.gro -p ../../anthracene.top -o anthracene_prod.tpr -maxwarn 4


NOTE 1 [file expanded.mdp, line 101]:
  For proper sampling of the (nearly) decoupled state, stochastic dynamics
  should be used


NOTE 2 [file expanded.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using verlet-buffer-tolerance.

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 6477.00

NOTE 3 [file expanded.mdp]:
  This run will generate roughly 5599 Mb of data
