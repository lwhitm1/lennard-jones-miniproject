  For proper sampling of the (nearly) decoupled state, stochastic dynamics
  should be used


NOTE 2 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/test_new_cutoffs/potential-shift/test_out/modified_1821/lambda_8/energy_eval.mdp]:
  Setting nstcalcenergy (100) equal to nstenergy (1)

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 3.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 3 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/test_new_cutoffs/potential-shift/test_out/modified_1821/lambda_8/energy_eval.mdp]:
  NVE simulation with an initial temperature of zero: will use a Verlet
  buffer of 10%. Check your energy drift!
