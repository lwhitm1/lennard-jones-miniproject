  For proper sampling of the (nearly) decoupled state, stochastic dynamics
  should be used


NOTE 2 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/2024.3_tests/gapsys/shift_force-switch/out/modified_92/lambda_9/energy_eval.mdp]:
  Setting nstcalcenergy (100) equal to nstenergy (1)

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 3.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 3 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/2024.3_tests/gapsys/shift_force-switch/out/modified_92/lambda_9/energy_eval.mdp]:
  NVE simulation with an initial temperature of zero: will use a Verlet
  buffer of 10%. Check your energy drift!

      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

NOTE: 33 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
