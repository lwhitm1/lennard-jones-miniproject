Executable:   /usr/local/bin/gmx

NOTE 1 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lj/FE/switch/75_9/prod_out/modified_543/lambda_1/energy_eval.mdp, line 43]:
  For proper sampling of the (nearly) decoupled state, stochastic dynamics
  should be used


NOTE 2 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lj/FE/switch/75_9/prod_out/modified_543/lambda_1/energy_eval.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using verlet-buffer-tolerance.


NOTE 3 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lj/FE/switch/75_9/prod_out/modified_543/lambda_1/energy_eval.mdp]:
  Setting nstcalcenergy (100) equal to nstenergy (1)

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 3.00

NOTE 4 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lj/FE/switch/75_9/prod_out/modified_543/lambda_1/energy_eval.mdp]:
  NVE simulation with an initial temperature of zero: will use a Verlet
  buffer of 10%. Check your energy drift!

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 1 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Can not increase nstlist because an NVE ensemble is used

NOTE: 18 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
