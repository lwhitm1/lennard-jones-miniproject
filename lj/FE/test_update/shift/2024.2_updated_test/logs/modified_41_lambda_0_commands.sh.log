NOTE 1 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/shift/updated_75_8/test_out/modified_41/lambda_0/energy_eval.mdp, line 42]:
  For proper sampling of the (nearly) decoupled state, stochastic dynamics
  should be used


NOTE 2 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/shift/updated_75_8/test_out/modified_41/lambda_0/energy_eval.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using
  verlet-buffer-tolerance.


NOTE 3 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/shift/updated_75_8/test_out/modified_41/lambda_0/energy_eval.mdp]:
  Setting nstcalcenergy (100) equal to nstenergy (1)

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 3.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 4 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/shift/updated_75_8/test_out/modified_41/lambda_0/energy_eval.mdp]:
  NVE simulation with an initial temperature of zero: will use a Verlet
  buffer of 10%. Check your energy drift!

GROMACS reminds you: "In science it often happens that scientists say, 'You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,' and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion." (Carl Sagan)
