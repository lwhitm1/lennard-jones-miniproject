NOTE 1 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/shift/updated_75_8/test_out/modified_144/lambda_1/energy_eval.mdp, line 42]:
  For proper sampling of the (nearly) decoupled state, stochastic dynamics
  should be used


NOTE 2 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/shift/updated_75_8/test_out/modified_144/lambda_1/energy_eval.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using
  verlet-buffer-tolerance.


NOTE 3 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/shift/updated_75_8/test_out/modified_144/lambda_1/energy_eval.mdp]:
  Setting nstcalcenergy (100) equal to nstenergy (1)

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 3.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 4 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/shift/updated_75_8/test_out/modified_144/lambda_1/energy_eval.mdp]:
  NVE simulation with an initial temperature of zero: will use a Verlet
  buffer of 10%. Check your energy drift!

NOTE: 35 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
