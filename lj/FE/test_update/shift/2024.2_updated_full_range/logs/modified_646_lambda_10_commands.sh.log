  For proper sampling of the (nearly) decoupled state, stochastic dynamics
  should be used

  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using
  verlet-buffer-tolerance.


NOTE 3 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/test_update/shift/2024.2_updated_full_range/test_out/modified_646/lambda_10/energy_eval.mdp]:
  Setting nstcalcenergy (100) equal to nstenergy (1)

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 3.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 4 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/test_update/shift/2024.2_updated_full_range/test_out/modified_646/lambda_10/energy_eval.mdp]:
  NVE simulation with an initial temperature of zero: will use a Verlet
  buffer of 10%. Check your energy drift!
