  Setting nstcalcenergy (100) equal to nstenergy (1)

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 3.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

  NVE simulation with an initial temperature of zero: will use a Verlet
  buffer of 10%. Check your energy drift!

GROMACS reminds you: "I have noticed a large, negative correlation between having a well-defined mission workload and concern for the Top500. It's almost like LINPACK is what you focus on when you don't know what to focus on." (Jeff Hammond)

GROMACS reminds you: "When I got my first job as a programmer there were quite a number of women doing programming because there was no computer science education and people were hired from many different fields if it seemed like they could do the work. It was better then, probably, in terms of proportions, not necessarily in women being paid as much as men and so forth, but definitely, there were women around." (Barbara Liskov)
