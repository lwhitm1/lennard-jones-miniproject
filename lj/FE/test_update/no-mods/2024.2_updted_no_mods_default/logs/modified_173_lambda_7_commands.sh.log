  For proper sampling of the (nearly) decoupled state, stochastic dynamics
  should be used

  Setting nstcalcenergy (100) equal to nstenergy (1)

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 3.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 3 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lennard-jones-miniproject/lj/FE/test_update/no-mods/2024.2_updted_no_mods_default/test_out/modified_173/lambda_7/energy_eval.mdp]:
  NVE simulation with an initial temperature of zero: will use a Verlet
  buffer of 10%. Check your energy drift!

GROMACS reminds you: "When I got my first job as a programmer there were quite a number of women doing programming because there was no computer science education and people were hired from many different fields if it seemed like they could do the work. It was better then, probably, in terms of proportions, not necessarily in women being paid as much as men and so forth, but definitely, there were women around." (Barbara Liskov)
