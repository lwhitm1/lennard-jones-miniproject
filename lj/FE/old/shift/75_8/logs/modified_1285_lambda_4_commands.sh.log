NOTE 1 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lj/FE/shift/75_8/prod_out/modified_1285/lambda_4/energy_eval.mdp, line 42]:
  For proper sampling of the (nearly) decoupled state, stochastic dynamics
  should be used


NOTE 2 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lj/FE/shift/75_8/prod_out/modified_1285/lambda_4/energy_eval.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using verlet-buffer-tolerance.


NOTE 3 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lj/FE/shift/75_8/prod_out/modified_1285/lambda_4/energy_eval.mdp]:
  Setting nstcalcenergy (100) equal to nstenergy (1)

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 3.00

NOTE 4 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lj/FE/shift/75_8/prod_out/modified_1285/lambda_4/energy_eval.mdp]:
  NVE simulation with an initial temperature of zero: will use a Verlet
  buffer of 10%. Check your energy drift!

GROMACS reminds you: "Where all think alike, no one thinks very much." (Walter Lippmann)

Setting the LD random seed to -409346081

Generated 6 of the 6 non-bonded parameter combinations

Excluding 1 bonded neighbours molecule type 'LJ1'

Excluding 1 bonded neighbours molecule type 'LJ2'

Coupling 1 copies of molecule type 'LJ2'
Analysing residue names:
There are:     2      Other residues
Analysing residues not classified as Protein/DNA/RNA/Water and splitting into groups...

This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 1 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Can not increase nstlist because an NVE ensemble is used
Using 1 MPI thread

0 steps,      0.0 ps.

NOTE: 49 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
