NOTE 1 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lj/no_FE/shift/75_9/shift_start_files/energy_eval.mdp, line 42]:
  Free energy is turned off, so we will not decouple the molecule listed in
  your input.


NOTE 2 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lj/no_FE/shift/75_9/shift_start_files/energy_eval.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using verlet-buffer-tolerance.


NOTE 3 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lj/no_FE/shift/75_9/shift_start_files/energy_eval.mdp]:
  Setting nstcalcenergy (100) equal to nstenergy (1)

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 3.00

NOTE 4 [file /home/lindseywhitmore/projects/lj/no_FE/shift/75_9/shift_start_files/energy_eval.mdp]:
  NVE simulation with an initial temperature of zero: will use a Verlet
  buffer of 10%. Check your energy drift!
